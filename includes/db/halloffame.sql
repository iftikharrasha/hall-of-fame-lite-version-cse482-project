I am your typical Dhaka school kid, the super mediocre student from the class of Spring, 2009.

But, it wasn’t until my father received an envelope from NSU with my first semester grades that I realized I could do better. He asked me, “Eta 4.00 na keno?”! He wasn’t stressing, he probably just thought, I could do better. It was a 3.94, by the way, well above my own expectation! Knowing well that he knew I didn’t have the most brilliant of minds, I slowly started to realize, I have been wrong my whole life, it had nothing to do with merit. ', 12, '', '', '', '', '', 0),

First as an undergraduate student then as an academic staff. My elder sister completed her graduation from NSU in computer science. I still remember very clearly the day I attended her graduation ceremony because that’s the day I made up my mind that after H.S.C. I am going to study at NSU. Looking back, perhaps that was one of the good decisions I have ever made in life. Those happy and confident faces during that graduation ceremony was such an inspiration and that’s why after my H.S.C. I applied only at NSU because I knew this is where I wanted to be.\r\n\r\nWhatever I have achieved professionally I give full credit to NSU. NSU has helped me become a team player (all those group projects...phew), be a confident speaker (those presentations) and be independent learner (every semester got new faces in class as I hardly had friends in the same course or section). I know we all go through immense pressure and hardship at NSU (with deadlines after deadlines) but it undeniably prepares us for future and “real” world that awaits straight after graduation (when the bubble bursts)!\r\n\r\nSince childhood I always wanted to be a teacher; however, teachers like JK sir (Junaid Khan), Mobina (Hasan) miss and TnH (Tania Hussain) are my true inspiration and why I ended up in this profession. After more than a decade I still remember their classes and honestly I try to follow their teaching style. I have taught in the U.K. and now I am teaching in New Zealand but some of the brightest minds I have come across was in NSU. Seeing my students excelling gives me the utmost joy and satisfaction and I feel proud to be part of their journey.\"\r\n\r\nMabel D Costa\r\nBatch: Fall, 2008\r\n\r\nFormer Senior Lecturer (2013-2017)\r\nNorth South University\r\n\r\nPh.D. Candidate and Assistant Lecturer\r\nMassey University, New Zealand', 1, '', '', '', '', '', 0),

I wanted to write something inspirational.\r\n\r\nBut nope, I am not about any of those. I am just a simple procrastinated geeky kind of a guy who just went on with his life. A life with a lot of curiosity that brought me to this present.\r\n\r\nOver the course of life, I got to learn the most in the past six years, 5 years of which I spent in this University called North South.\r\n\r\nI went through heartbreaks & depressions, I met people good and bad, I met few of the brightest minds and I got to explore a lot. Both in and outside of the university, but I believe everything played along to bring me here so no regrets.\r\n\r\nMy first three years were nothing but a simple every introvert student\'s life in NSU, but things started to change. I wanted to make those change and NSU, the few people in it helped me achieve them little by little. I am still an introvert I would say though, for the most part of it.\r\n\r\nThe last two years while I struggled to keep a decent enough CGPA, I also knew it alone wasn’t enough. So I worked in places, harnessed knowledge from people both in and outside of the university. Got to run a club from being a Sub-Executive body member to an Advisor for 1.5 years which I so dearly care about (P.S. It’s The Marketing Club, maybe check it out?). All the people I met along, juniors or seniors, many of these people became my inspiration through & through and helped me go through all the adversary.\r\n\r\nI cannot jot down all the names here, but key people or teachers who helped me along the way I would like to mention them. Anwarul Sadat Shimul (AwS) sir foremost for his advice to explore and help me understand my own passion. I still follow that advice and will always do.\r\n\r\nMuntasir Masum sir, for guiding me during one of the toughest times of my life. I wouldn’t have got through without your guidance. Narmin Tartila (NTB) mam, for helping me understand the right career path and in choosing Uber back at that time.\r\n\r\nThere are many more people I wish I could mention, but I can’t (trying to keep it enough short?). I hope they do know and understand who they are because I do appreciate them being in my life.\r\n\r\nI will add one thing at the very end. One advice for all the people who want to seek something. \'Good\' or \'bad\', this university gives you the platform to connect and learn. Connect with people and learn from them & their lives, find inspiration and harness knowledge. Junior or seniors doesn’t matter when it comes to that, just make sure you are doing it with respect. Help those in need if possible. There is no need to compete to do good in the long run, you just need to thrive and seek meaningful experience. That is at least what I followed.\"\r\n\r\nMd.

Let’s start it from 2009. A fifteen years old teenager was crying like hell after missing Golden A+ in his SSC Exam. He was never a great student but neither a bad one. At least he deserved this so called ‘Golden A+’ but alas he missed in the only subject he was really good at- ‘English’. So, the society did not let him escape this downfall. The atmosphere was like a living hell for him. Not only the society, he was also lost into himself because he lost one of his dream of his life- ‘Notre Dame College’ and the society made sure he remembered this sufferings every second for the rest of next two years.\r\n\r\nThree fall went by. That teenager, Nafis, stepped out of his teenage and started his university career in North South University, one of the best schools of business of Bangladesh. Did I try to admit into NSU from the beginning?- ‘Never’. I was a student of science and always wanted to study engineering. But, I was a mediocre student and could not get chance in BUET. Though, I got chance in some of the public varsities but still, NSU seemed like a better option (though I did not know much about this place and to be honest I heard many negative staffs of this university from the people around me). My NSU life began in the last week of January, 2012. Soon, this place became a home to me. A home where I can truly learn the field of Business & Finance and many more. NSU changed lot of my dimensions of my life. It helped me to become a better human being in terms of knowledge & professionalism & integrity. This place made me realize that life is a lot bigger than a GPA-5 or a high CGPA. If you have true passion, you will certainly do well in anything.\r\n\r\nAlhamdulillah, by the grace of Almighy Allah, the most merciful & beneficent, now I work as an Assistant Manager, Global Banking in Standard Chartered New York. As I did not have an excellent CGPA, I always had a fear of not getting a job. Alhamdulillah, I am from an affluent family but I never wanted to get dependent on my father’s income. I used to teach students from the beginning of my NSU life. I earned money and I enjoyed it always. So, from the final quarter of my NSU life, I started to look out for jobs. Luckily, I got one before I finished my internship in BSEC. I worked in that outsourcing Medical Billing firm, ‘Medical Management Strategies’ for 6 months and then I moved into a Vietnam based Multinational IT Firm, ‘FPT Information System’. While I was working there, I got an opportunity in Standard Chartered Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nI feel privileged to get an opportunity in this mighty great multinational organization with some of the best minds around. Like always, I was a mediocre employee in that new team. But, one thing I was good at and that I learnt from the faculties of North South University- ‘Hard Work’. I can work really hard with passion. I never worked to get something special. I worked hard because I loved to do my job. It was somehow recognized by the management and I got promoted in my first year and became one of the best performer from South Asia & one of the best 16 individuals from all over the world in 2018 in terms of Productivity. And, 6 months down the line, I am now in Standard Chartered USA.\r\n\r\nSo, how did it all happen? I am a man of faith. I know it happened because Allah wanted to make it happen. I do not believe I have any credit for this. I got immense support from my mother, father, my love of my life & my brother. I feel privileged I have a family like this. I am glad I made it here for them and I need to go a long way as an honest man for them only.\r\nIn the end, it was always North South which changed the inner me. It was a place where I loved to spend my time. I made some of the best friends of lifetime who are also doing great. I cannot forget a single faculty who taught me. Some of them inspired me so much that sometimes, I miss NSU terribly only because of them. They were not my teacher, they were my mentors, they were my guardians, they were my lights in the dusk.\r\n\r\nBefore I end, I would like to recommend three things for anyone who read this- Have complete believe in Allah (or what you call Him in your religion), Try to be your own competitor & Set your own goals & priorities. In Shaa Allah, you will get success in your life by following these.\r\nFinally, Thank you, NSU for everything. I miss you every single day.

I chose to get admitted myself into NSU in spite of all the queries and concerns of different people around me. I often heard whispers around me : “ Why a private university, why North South? ” I chose not to answer then.\r\n\r\nAfter completing 2 years at NSU I decided to give a shot into applying to a North American University. With not much expectation I randomly sent an application to George Mason University in Virginia and guess what? Not only they accepted me but accepted 54 credits out of 60 credits from NSU !\r\n\r\nAfter having completed my Bachelors I came back to Dhaka. The home sick girl inside wanted to be back home. I finished my MBA. Did I try for a public university this time? Not exactly ! I could not think of any other place but NSU to finish my Masters. Oh how much I had missed this place, the cafeteria, the study hall, the bookstore, the teachers ! It was so good to be back home !\r\n\r\nNow I am a Faculty at the United International University. I teach MIS and Operations Management to undergraduate students. I remember that day when I came for the Faculty Recruitment Interview at UIU and each and every candidate except me had a Public University background. When they got to know about me getting an MBA from North South, I heard them giggling and gossiping about me. But Alhamdulillah the interview panel chose me over the rest.\r\n\r\nTill now whenever anyone asks me about my educational background I do not say I graduated from North America.

Never in my wildest dream I saw myself to be an NSUer and here I am today an NSU alumni and, I can assure you I will not have it any other way. Being an Engineering student I have not been a typical nerd and introvert rather I have always been out there and proudly represented North South University in different platforms. It has been a privilege hoisting the flag of NSU and bringing the glory.\r\n\r\nAs a strong advocate of female rights I can proudly say NSU is one of the very few places where you are treated equally and provided with equal opportunities. You can be as fierce as you desired to be.\r\n\r\nNow, when I look back to those torturous 8 am classes, weekend exams, 10 pm classes during the month of Ramadan after the fire incident, I realize that those have only made me stronger and better.\r\n\r\nNSU teaches you nothing comes your way easy, if you want it you have to work for it and achieve it. You make friends and foes. NSU makes us prepared for the ruthless world ahead.

Unlike some cool kids who were self diagnosed with ADHD I wasn\'t really happy about it when my doctor said \"its okay honey, you\'ll be alright in a few years\". At this point i already knew \"THERE\'S NO FUTURE\" for me. But I was desperate to come out of it. Crying wasn\'t helping me solve my accounting, stats and math problems.\r\nHowever, by the grace of Almighty, at the age of 21, I was already living the life i had only dreamt of. I quit studying with out even thinking for a second time because \"who needs education\" right?. There was no point of it. People with degrees don\'t really represent the \"knowledgeable\" community, people with lots of knowledge don\'t use it for anything extra ordinary. Our mentors don\'t understand our mentality, the term motivation is only seen in the videos. They teach us how to memorize numbers and texts but not to utilize our ability to give our life a shape. People spend money and waste years to achieve honorable degrees and then just sit around gossiping about someone else\'s personal life. How stupid is that?\r\nBut it was untill i started studying in NSU again when i realised it wasn\'t about the others. It was me. Every time I stepped in to the campus i learned something new. Not from the book, but from the teachers, not for the degree but for my own betterment. I am not even one of the top performers in my class, I only enrol after every 1 or 2 semesters. I dont even want my degree any time soon. Most importantly, most of the faculties have understood my insights and point of view. It\'s not about how quick you finish the race. Life isnt only about classrooms, office and retirement. Explore it before it finishes in a snap of a second. The society wont be there to cheer you up when you realise you have done nothing in your life apart from listening to the society but your heart. Today hundreds and thousands of angry people try to teach me how to live my life. They fail to realise the fact that they dont even have minimum access to enter my life. They are not a part of the memories I have built, the experiences I have gathered, the people I have met, the happiness I have achieved, the changes I have made, the life I have lived.

Join clubs, two or more, become an EB if you can, otherwise just meet, meet, meet as many people, get to know them and do epic shit together, spend time with your faculty members, try to become a TA or at least a voluntary one, get involved with research projects, get some expel-worthy-if-they-ever-found-out-experiences under your belt!

I set foot at STR building Banani campus in 2001 hoping to be a Computer Engineer. Fast forward to 2017, I am an expert in product development and management, winner of Top Progressive Woman Leader award in Bangladesh, managing Digital Partnership at the leading Telecom Operator in Bangladesh. You never know what life has in store for you but things turned out way better than expected, largely due to NSU.\r\n\r\nI finished my first year at North South University with couple of C+ grades as I was preparing to exchange credits to a Canadian university. I would also blame my poor grades on the newly launched pool tables at Boomers Cafe. Credit exchange attempt fell through and I was stuck with a CGPA below 2.5. When I back-calculated my grades, I realized that I had no choice but to get A (93 or above marking) in all courses for two years straight to graduate with a decent CGPA of 3. All my glorious plans for lazy evening adda at the SPZ cafeteria and over ambitious plans for YES Club looked bleak.\r\n\r\nThen NSU happened. With the guidance of some amazing faculties, I passed all 300 and 400 level courses with flying colors. I still remember the support of Riad Mahmud (RMD) sir, Kenan I. Bakht (SIB) sir and Junaid Khan (JK) sir. When I look back, I feel truly blessed to get mentorship from such legendary faculties. They made the most difficult advanced courses interesting and effortless. During this time, I decided to aim for dual major and a distinction. I achieved both in my BBA program. And yes, I neither sacrificed my addas nor club activities.\r\n\r\nI had the opportunity of working as a Research Assistant in my final year and that experience helped me to get my internship. NSU not only helped us with job applications, it also supported deserving students with scholarships and I was luckily one of them. YES Club (Young Entrepreneurs Society) gave me the opportunity to build a close network of successful, influential and like-minded people. A lot of my presentation and writing skills were developed while working for the club.\r\n\r\nNSU is the place where I made - my first friends in Bangladesh, my first pay check, my career decision, my first internship, my first job! Banani campus was my second home and we all knew each other due to the limited intake of students. The street which we used as a \"campus\" was the heart of all activities. Four years passed by in the blink of an eye. All the bitter moments of university life - pulling an all-nighter before the final exam, pop quizzes, no-show at group presentations, faulty floppy disks on the final presentation day, standing in long queues to get photocopies, taking the staircase to the 14th floor of STR building because of overcrowded elevators, bad food at the cafeteria - turned into precious memories of a lifetime. As the saying goes - we didn\'t realize we were making memories, we just knew we were having fun.\r\n\r\nI keep bumping into familiar faces wherever I go and nothing makes me more proud than to see fellow alumni doing so well in different fields and in different parts of the world.

And like most families of today’s youth, my family’s suggestion was for a public university initially. After sitting for exams, I actually started studying in a public university; however, the university was quite far away. Which is why travelling to the campus regularly and studying became a tough job. Once after returning to Dhaka, my family suggested me to seek admission at a private university in Dhaka. This is where my story of NSU started.\r\n\r\nThe reason for choosing NSU was a peculiar one. The first time I entered the campus, I felt in love with it. I still think the decision taken at that time is one of the best decisions that I have ever taken, for which I am grateful to the Almighty.\r\n\r\nNSU played a significant role behind where I stand in right now and the dreams I dare to dream. I can proudly say that NSU hasn’t created me as a typical undergrad nor a graduate, rather it has helped me to become a complete human being. With excellent curriculum combined with the life in campus and the experiences gained is a massive achievement, and I don’t think I could find it the same way in some other place.\r\n\r\nI used to debate from my school life, so I joined the Debate Club after starting my life in NSU. My clubbing started from this historically glorious club and as a result I have taken part in many other activities as well. And truth be told, this rollercoaster academic life was quite eventful. We were like a family. We had laughs, we had tears. It seems as if the days have passed by so fast. Thanks to debating, I have traveled to a lot of places to debate. Carrying the flag of NSU has always been special. Wearing this badge, we have claimed 19 Inter University Debate Championship titles throughout the country. Every time the name \"Team-NSU\" was called out in the prize giving ceremony, the feeling can\'t comparable with anything else. And as the more days passed by, the more I got attached to this badge, I felt prouder. It was really an honor to be a part of NSU Debate Team.\r\n\r\nAfter four years, I still look back and think, if only the ride could be never ended and if only I could reclaim last four years to relive them again, maybe the stories would be even more eventful. Wherever I go in life, I will always miss this journey. Be it the pressure of advising, the pile of assignment and projects or standing behind the debate podium representing NSU, be it the streaks of happiness chanting “NSU! NSU!” after winning. In the end, I must say that love is the only thing that NSU has from my heart.

This was a theater of dreams for me where we can write stories of friendship, love and a lot of fakibaji. Anything but studying was my priority back then. I was the kind of a guy who ‘went with the flow’. I skipped midterms just so that I can attend a very important cricket match that was taking place in the gallery & yeah I had a ponytail too. I had my high school besties as my batch mates. What else do you need! Those addas in the gallery, lining up together for the re-advising, fighting to find a spot in the cafeteria were priceless.\r\n\r\nI was content at being average but NSU transformed me. It was at my 6th semester where I hit rock bottom. I knew I was better than what my grades reflected. I told myself the only move I can afford to make is rise after hitting such a low. I needed inspiration. I needed someone who would guide me and shape me into a person who can take responsibilities, handle pressure and perform by believing in himself. The person who inspired me was Farzana Choudhury Mam. She shaped me into the professional that I am today. She brought the best out of me.\r\n\r\nBy the end of my undergrad, I had a decent enough CGPA and a ton load of confidence to fight it out in the corporate jungle. NSU taught me how to ride a storm and come out on top stronger and better. The greatest realization that I had was, sometimes, it’s better to fall, get shattered into pieces, hit the rock bottom because once your back is against the wall, there is no other option than striking back hard & that is when you realize your full potential. Once you rise after such a fall, there will be nothing that will ever be able to hold you back.

Also, the finals somehow turned even the friendliest professors into heartless souls.\r\nI know what you’re thinking. It’s not worth it. But it is.

When your parents, friends and teachers introduce you to others as a genius, even though you’re still quite stupid, it’s worth it.

As per tradition I got admitted in to one of the most reputed public universities of the country, but sadly the institution was not able to fulfill my expectation.

I had no expectation at all and I was just going by the flow. But I had no idea that it was just the start of an epic journey for me.\r\n\r\nI won\'t focus much on the academics because that is completely up to an individual, if one studies no matter which institution it is they will succeed, NSU definitely has a great environment to learn and excel. But the opportunities besides academics that NSU provides is in my opinion the best in the country and I can vouch that we can compare ourselves on the global scale.\r\n\r\nMy life took a one eighty degree turn once I started to incorporate myself with the clubs and the extra-curricular opportunities that NSU provided their students. I had the privilege of working with fantastic clubs- NSUCC, AIESEC, NSUDC, YEF etc. The people and the environment of these clubs were so rich that it completely changed my view towards life. I got to learn so much and at the same time they helped me to develop my skills a lot. Since then my network started to grow and I had the opportunity to work with Kotler Impact, meeting Philip Kotler was an extra ordinary experience, volunteering for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, BD and one of the best moments in my life was leading the Bangladeshi student delegation in the UN HQ, NY.\r\n\r\nBeing an NSU student I led the whole Bangladeshi delegation in a Model UN conference at the UN HQ where we became one of the outstanding delegations.

I was the founding General Secretary and later on the President of the club and not only did we establish ourselves as one of the best in the International arena we have been the best in the local arena too.\r\n\r\nI am not saying there aren\'t any hurdles, I faced a lot of hurdles in NSU while trying to pursue my dreams. There will always be factors that will try to pull you down but the most important factor is not to give up. NSU is filled with opportunities if one did not work out for me I opted for the next instead of breaking down. As an individual I was able to sharpen my skills that later on helped me a lot in shaping my career decision. Right now I work for the worlds number one NGO and only the best of the best gets to work here. So my small advice to any one in NSU is to look for the opportunities that suits them, I firmly believe they wont regret it.\r\n\r\nToday I feel lucky that I chose NSU at one of the worst point of my life. A depressed, confused and a lost boy who entered NSU with no hopes ended up having an epic journey that transformed him in to a leader and a better human being.\"\r\n\r\nAhnaf Tahmid\r\nBatch: Fall, 2010\r\n\r\nCo-Founder and Former President of NSU Model UN Club\r\nYoung professional, BRAC', 0, '', '', '', '', '', 0),

This is so because as with every other person, students learn more effectively through the force of example rather than advice. Deeds have always been more powerful than words. Therefore teachers can have a positive influence on their students by being role models - human beings who are virtuous. Honesty, truthfulness, trustworthiness, helpfulness, courtesy and sincerity are qualities that can be acquired through witnessing an exemplary character. No matter what we say or advice, our actions are always louder and more forceful.\r\nMy career here at NSU has therefore been of great moral value to me because I have tried to teach my students things that will give meaning and purpose to life, through my own example.\r\nIn an age and milieu where the media has total and undeniable influence on youngsters and where unfortunately a lot of negative things are put across as trends and the order of the day, I believe it is of imperative necessity that teachers strive to set up examples. Young people need to see that there are better role models than what the media or the cinema puts up, that there is a way of life that can contribute to the betterment of society, that consumerism, materialism, narcissism and the excessive attention to physical beautification or the glorification of sex does not serve our best interests and cannot conduce to the welfare or well-being of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nVarqa Shamsi Bahar\r\n\r\nSenior Lecturer\r\nChair, Student Engagement and Support Committee\r\nDepartment of Marketing and International Business\r\nSchool of Business and Economics', 0, '', '', '', '', '', 0),

However, as reality struck and the staggering cost of a 4 year degree at an university in North America came into picture, my hopes of getting there kinda went flying out the window. Quite depresses and demotivated I clearly remember being very lost at that time. In myriad of this depression, I started my university life at NSU with a lot of demotivation thinking that I will now never be able to explore my full potential, but my god was I wrong. My 5 years at NSU was the best years of my life and I can honestly say that having an university life anywhere else would have not been this vibrant. From Mojo mama\'s cha to card games at gallery to Bashir sir\'s class to Bobby Sir\'s presentation, I have absolutely enjoyed and cherished everything. NSU has offered brilliant mix of learning and fun and has shaped me absolutely as a focused young professional and a leader. I was very demotivated when I started NSU but when I came out, I was a confident young person. Apart from the academics, participating in club activities, business competition and organizing other social events really helped me to become confident and organized. This added confidence really helped me to land my first job at MGH group as a Trainee Officer and then in a span of next 2 years I worked for two other organizations, one Bitopi Leo Burnett as a Brand Associate and two at Magnito Digital as a Business Development Executive and both of which were advertising agencies. After a short yet very successful six month at Magnito, I joined Reckitt Benckiser as a Management Trainee and now I am working in the same organization as a Trade Category Manager and the experience so far here has been nothing short of amazing. NSU has opened so many doors for us that no academic organization never could. I am supremely proud to be an NSUer.\"\r\n\r\nS.M.
